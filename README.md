# Project Title

To do list Immersive Program Practice

## Getting Started

This is a JavaScript test, it does not use frameworks, but it uses a pair of small Node.js modules. It has already a develpment server running via Budo. Budo is also using Browserify to create a bundle of all .js files (modules).

The HTML file (index.html) is generated on the fly by Budo. It also sets Browserify to use Babelify to transpile ES. Budo runs from the package.json script dev.

Lastly, it uses a small library for building modular UI components. It is called yo-yo


### Installing

Clone the repo from https://github.com/smoothness/js-entry-test
Install node modules
$ npm install

## Running

Run the development server and the JSON-Server with the start script
$ npm run start
The Budo development server will refresh the browser automagically.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
